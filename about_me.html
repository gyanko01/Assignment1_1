        <h1>Gigi Y.</h1>
        <p> In 2023 I went to Bulgaria, which is my birth country. I went to visit family and I visited two towns in Bulgaria.
            The one town is called Lom, which sits on Danube river and on the opposite side you can see Romania.
            The other town,which is actually a big sea resort city is called Varna. It is on Black Sea. It has a lot of beaches, small sea villages and  places with access to Black Sea.
            While in Varna, I visited a historic landmark town from centuries ago, before even the country was established. It was very interesting to see the creativity of how the living habits of these
            tribes were represented in 21st century.

        <strong>My 3 favorite pet names are:</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A dog named Koby</li>
            <li>A cat named Gizmo</li>
            <li> A dog named Johnny</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of my favorite restaurants is Bar Bill Tavern in East Aurora, NY. The restaurant is very famous in Western New York area. It is local and offers one of Buffalo's staple foods- Chicken Wings.
            It is my favorite restaurant because it is authentic, local and the wings are one of a kind. A lot of visitors from outside of Western New York, go to this restaurant to try their famous chicken wings.
        Because of that it is really hard to find free tables and the waiting time is very long, so the guests of the restaurant have to be patient.</p>

            <p>Lasagna is one of my favorite foods. I like to eat it warm, fresh out of the oven.I like to have some tomato sauce on the bottom of the plate.I like the layers to be stacekd still, not broken down. I like to eat it as soon as possible while the cheese is still stretchy.</p>
